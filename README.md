# Chandrayaan-3-Lunar-Craft-Galactic-Space-Craft-Control
The spacecraft navigates through the galaxy using galactic coordinates, represented by x, y, z coordinates (x for east or west location, y for north or south location, and z for distance above or below the galactic plane).
You will be given the initial starting point (x, y, z) of the spacecraft and the direction it is facing (N, S, E, W, Up, Down).
Move the spacecraft forward/backward (f, b): The spacecraft moves one step forward or backward based on its current direction.
Turn the spacecraft left/right (l, r): The spacecraft rotates 90 degrees to the left or right, changing its facing direction.
Turn the spacecraft up/down (u, d): The spacecraft changes its angle, rotating upwards or downwards.
